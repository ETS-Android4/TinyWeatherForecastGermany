What is new in this version ([VERSION]):

- Gadgetbridge-Support: fixed max. temperature in forecast
- experimental, new and hopefully more frequent delivery of weather data to the GadgetBridge App
- change of weather icons
- weather forecast now available for the next 10 days
- new option to repeat update every 10 minutes when there is no network
- new experimental feature to catch up on a due update once there is a network available
- new options for local logging (debugging)
- revised settings

With this version, the app changes the API at the Deutscher Wetterdienst. With this change, more accurate forecasts can be displayed, but it goes with a very fundamental remodeling. Therefore, new errors may occur.

Settings have been set back to the default values.

Important notice:
Should the app crash after a change of the weather station, please report this station to me.

The app can be brought back into a functional state by deleting the app data; this will set back the default values as well and the app will display the weather in Hamburg again.
