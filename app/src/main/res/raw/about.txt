Privacy policy:
---------------

Tiny Weather Forecast Germany polls weather data and weather warnings from the open-data portal of the Deutscher Wetterdienst <https://www.dwd.de/DE/Home/home_node.html>.

Do do so, it is technically required to send your IP-address to the Deutscher Wetterdienst in the context of the internet connection and also the place/sensor, for which the data has to be polled. How this data is handled and stored by the Deutscher Wetterdienst is explained in the privacy policy of the Deutscher Wetterdienst <https://www.dwd.de/EN/service/dataprotection/dataprotection_node.html>.

The weather forecasts and weather warnings are saved locally on the device, also the set-up places/sensors. The settings and some internal variables like the last time of a weather warnings poll are also saved locally on the device.

If activated by the user, Tiny Weather Forecast Germany passes the weather data locally on the device to the Gadgetbridge <https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge> app, so that the weather data can be displayed on wearables.

Beyond that, Tiny Weather Forecast Germany does not save, send and/or share any data.
